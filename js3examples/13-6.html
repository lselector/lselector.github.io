<!--  This file implements a navigation bar, designed to go in a frame at
      the bottom of a window. Include it in a frameset like the following:

        <frameset rows="*,75">
        <frame src="about:blank">
        <frame src="navigation.html">
        </frameset>

<SCRIPT>
// The function is invoked by the Back button in our navigation bar.
function go_back() 
{
    // First, clear the URL entry field in our form.
    document.navbar.url.value = "";

    // Then use the History object of the main frame to go back.
    parent.frames[0].history.back();

    // Wait a second, and then update the URL entry field in the form
    // from the location.href property of the main frame. The wait seems
    // to be necessary to allow the location.href property to get in sync.
