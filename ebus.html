<p>There are many online malls (like Amazon's Z-shops, Yahoo's stores,
e-Bay, etc.) where you can place your products for moderate fee.
<p>Another alternative is to construct your own site.
<br>Here is how to make it easy for just one product:
<br>1. Get yourself an inexpensive hosting accout (unix, perl, MySQL, qmail
&amp; ezmlm)
<br>2. Make a one-page sales letter as your home page
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Use a pop-up offerring a valuable report by email
- thus get email address of a prospect.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Make a link to order form at the bottom.
<br>3. Use some free or inexpensive shopping cart (for example <a href="http://www.merchantorderform.com/">www.merchantorderform.com</a>
)
<br>4. Use 3rd party secure services (like&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bidpay.com">www.bidpay.com</a>
,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.paypal.com">www.paypal.com</a> ) to collect
payments.
<p>Consider using this:

Akopia, bought by RedHat)

<p>To get some taste, read these 20+ tips checklist on how to promote your
site from the <a href="http://www.wilsonweb.com">wilsonweb.com</a>, 1998:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>___1. Write a Page Title. Write a descriptive title for each page of
5 to 8 words. Remove as many "filler" words from the title, such as "the,"
"and," etc. This page title appears on the Web search engines when your
page is found. Entice surfers to click on the title by making it a bit
provocative. Place this at the top of the Web page between the &lt;HEADER>&lt;/HEADER>
tags, in this format: &lt;TITLE>Web Marketing Checklist - 23 Ways to Promote
Your Site&lt;/TITLE>
<p>___2. List Keywords. Prepare a list of 50 to 100 keywords - the kind
of words that if someone entered one of these words, you'd like him to
find your site. Make sure that you don't repeat any word more than three
times. Place those words at the top of the Web page, between the &lt;HEADER>&lt;/HEADER>
tags, in a META tag in this format:
<br>&lt;META NAME="KEYWORDS" CONTENT="promoting, promotion, Web marketing,
online sales ...">
<p>___3. Write a Page Description. Select the most important 20 keywords,
and write a careful 200 to 250 character (including spaces) sentence or
two. You don't need to repeat any words used in the page title. Keep this
readable but tight. Eliminate as many "filler" words as you can, to make
room for the important words, the keywords which do the actual work for
you. Place those words at the top of the Web page, between the &lt;HEADER>&lt;/HEADER>
tags, in a META tag in this format:
<br>&lt;META NAME="DESCRIPTION" CONTENT="Increase visitor hits, attracting
traffic through submitting URLs, META tags, news releases, banner ads,
and reciprocal links">
<p>___4. Submit Page to Search Engines. Next, submit your page to the important
Web search engines and directories. To do this, consider using a submission
service such as Submit-It http://www.submit-it.com and All4one Submission
Machine http://www.all4one.com/all4submit/ The most important search engines
which robotically "spider" your site are: AltaVista, Excite, HotBot, Lycos,
Infoseek, and WebCrawler.
<p>___5. Submit Page to Yahoo. Yahoo is probably the most important listing
of all - though it's technically a directory, rather than a search engine.
It uses real humans to read (and too often, pare down) your 200 character
sentence, so be very careful, and follow their instructions. http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/include.html
<p>___6. Submit Page to Other Directories. You've probably seen offers
to submit your pages to 300 different search engines. Don't bother. The
most important 25 are probably enough, unless you find some specific to
your industry. Many of the rest are wannabe's that solicit you for "upgraded
listings." These marginal directories come and go very quickly making it
hard to keep up.
<p>___7. Request Links on Industry Sites. You probably belong to various
trade associations that feature member sites. Ask for a link.
<p>___8. Include URL on Stationery, Cards, and Literature. Make sure that
all reprints of cards, stationery, brochures, and literature contain your
company's URL. And see that your printer gets the URL syntax correct, with
slashes leaning right rather than left.
<p>___9. Include URL in Display Advertising. We don't recommend discontinuing
print advertising you've found to be effective. But be sure to include
your URL in any display or classified ads you purchase in trade journals,
newspapers, etc. View your website as an information adjunct to the ad.
Catch readers' attention with the ad, and then refer them to a Web page
where they can obtain more information or perhaps place an order.
<p>___10. Develop a Free Service to Market. It's one thing to say, "Come
to our site and learn about our business." It's quite another to say "Use
the free kitchen remodeling calculator available exclusively on our site."
Make no mistake, it's expensive in time and energy to develop free resources
such as our Web Marketing Info Center http://www.wilsonweb.com/webmarket/
but it is very rewarding in increased traffic to your site. Make sure that
your free service is closely related to what you are selling, so the visitors
you attract will also be good prospects for your business. Give visitors
multiple opportunities to enter the part of the site where you're marketing
your product or service.
<p>___11. Request Reciprocal Links. Find complementary websites and request
a reciprocal link to your site (especially to your free service, if you
offer one). Develop an out-of-the way page where you put links to other
sites - so you don't send people out the back door as fast as you bring
them in the front door.
<p>___12. Issue News Releases. Find newsworthy events (such as the launching
of your free service), and send news releases to print and Web periodicals
in your industry. You may want to use a Web news release service, such
as one offered by Eric Ward's URLwire http://www.urlwire.com
<p>___13. Request Links from Business Link Sites. Especially if you offer
a free service, you can request links from many of the small business linking
pages on the Web. When you have something free to offer, many doors open
to you. Surf the Net looking for places that might link to your site. Then
e-mail the site owner or webmaster with your site name, URL, and a brief
200-word description of what you offer there.
<p>___14. Capture Visitor E-mail Addresses and Request Permission to Send
Updates. On your website's response form, include a checkbox where the
visitor can give you permission to e-mail updates about products or services.
Now your e-mails to visitors are not "spam." You're responding to their
request for more information.
<p>___15. Publish an E-Mail Newsletter. While it's a big commitment in
time, publishing a weekly, monthly, or quarterly newsletter is one of the
very best ways to keep in touch with your prospects, generate trust, develop
brand awareness, and build future business. You can distribute your newsletter
using your e-mail program, or have people subscribe on your website directly
to a Majordomo program offered by your Internet Service Provider. More
information can be found at http://www.wilsonweb.com/articles/majordomo.htm
<p>___16. Install a "Signature" in your E-Mail Program. Most e-mail programs
such as Eudora or Netscape allow you to designate a "signature" to appear
at the end of each message you send. Limit it to 6 to 8 lines: Company
name, address, phone number, URL, e-mail address, and a one-phrase description
of your unique business offerings. Look for examples on e-mail messages
sent to you.
<p>___17. Promote Your Site in Mailing Lists and News Groups. The Internet
offers thousands of very targeted mailing lists and news groups made up
of people with very specialized interests. Use DejaNews http://www.dejanews.com
to find appropriate sources. Don't bother with news groups constituted
of pure "spam." Instead, find groups where a dialog is taking place. Don't
use aggressive marketing, even if you see other jerks doing so. Rather,
join in the discussion and let the "signature" at the end of your e-mail
message do your marketing for you. People will gradually get to know and
trust you, visit your site, and do business with you.
<p>___18. Join a Mall. You may gain a little traffic this way, but not
a lot. The biggest and free-est mall, if you will, is Yahoo. Get a good
listing there, and you won't need other malls very much.
<p>___19. Announce a Contest. People like getting something free. If you
publicize a contest or drawing available on your site, you'll generate
more traffic than normal.
<p>___20. Join a Banner Exchange Program. Of the many banner exchange programs,
LinkExchange is the biggest. http://www.linkexchange.com Essentially, you
agree to show a rotating banner on your site for other LinkExchange members,
and they do the same for you.
<p>___21. Purchase Banner Ads on Appropriate Sites. You may need to spend
money to boost traffic by purchasing banner advertising. Choose sites that
seem to attract the kinds of people who would be good prospects for your
business or product. Expect to pay $10 to $40 per thousand people who see
your ad, and achieve a click-through rate of 1% to 2%. You can find media
brokers such as WPRC http://www.wprc.com/pldb/wprcpldb.shtml who can help
you find appropriate and cost-effective places to advertise.
<p>___22. Use traditional promotional media. You may decide to use traditional
media to drive people to your site, such as direct mail, classifieds, display
ads, etc. This can be especially helpful in smaller industry niches.
<p>___23. Rent targeted e-mail lists. We abhor "spam," bulk untargeted,
unsolicited e-mail. But the direct marketing industry has developed targeted
e-mail lists you can rent of people who have agreed to receive commercial
e-mail messages.</td>

<td>Amazing New Ebook For Japanese Garden Lovers!&nbsp;
<br>Dear Fellow Japanese Garden Lover,&nbsp;
<br>I know your time is valuable so I'll be to the point.&nbsp;
<br>I need your advice!&nbsp;
<br>I'm putting the finishing touches on a new e-book that's all about
Japanese Gardens and I want to make sure I don't leave anything out.&nbsp;
<br>So, will you let me know your biggest question about Japanese Gardening?
It could be anything...even if you think it's silly.&nbsp;
<br>All you have to do is type your question in the little box below and
click submit. In exchange for your advice, I'll give you a free copy of
the book when it's ready. (Should be a few weeks.)&nbsp;
<br>OK, here's the easy form:&nbsp;
<br>What's your biggest question about Japanese Gardens?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
<br>E-Mail Address: (This will only be used to let you know when the book
is ready. No other email will ever be sent.)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
<br>Your Name:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
<br>Thank you very much for helping make this the best Japanese Gardening
book possible.&nbsp;
<br>Sincerely,&nbsp;
<br>First Last
